Hi!

I am Felipe, Brazilian, 24 years old and over 7 years working in software development.

I love technology and everything that can be created with it, I like to explore and always learn something new, and in my free time, I like to read, play chess, or create new features for personal projects.

During my professional career, I have provided services to startups, mid-companies, and also large companies like Banco Itaú and Uber. On a daily basis, I like to discuss ideas, and best practices, and also share knowledge inside and outside the team.

I currently live in Santiago and work with multicultural teams of people from many places in the world, creating projects that impact and scale the growth and quality of the company's technical processes.
