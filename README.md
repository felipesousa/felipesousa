## Skills

As a front end here are some technologies, frameworks and languages that I've worked in the last few years:

- CSS (CSS-in-JS / CSS Pre-processors )
- HTML (HTML 5 / Accessibility / Web Components)
- NodeJS (Native API / Frameworks and Libraries / Creating custom modules)

Exists a lot of different projects that I've experimented in those years, in a general perspective I think the web base (HTML, CSS and Javascript (and your ecosystem) are whats is more important when we talk about web development.
