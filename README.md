Hi,

My name is Luis Felipe Sousa, I'm from Brazil and since 2019 I live in Santiago, Chile. I work as a Frontend Developer since 2015. Working as a developer, the technology has always inspired me to learn and acquire multiple hard and soft skills, languages and to meet amazing people who teach me to create new and more sophisticated software projects.

I enjoy the practice of shared knowledge and leadership, whenever possible I try to create online content about technology or others things.

I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [@uber](/https://github.com/uber). My hobbies include read (really, I love books), play chess, ride in bike and travel, I'm always looking to some new place to go!
