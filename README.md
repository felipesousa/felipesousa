Hi, welcome!

My name is Luis Felipe Sousa, I work with web application development and software systems since 2015. Working with technology has always inspired me to learn and acquire multiple skills, languages and to meet amazing people who teach me to create new and more sophisticated software projects.

I enjoy the practice of shared knowledge and leadership, I like to participate and know the stages of the project I work on so I can give my best and propose new ideas.

I'm passionate about FrontEnd development and its extensions (Native and Hybrid Applications, PWA, SPAs, etc), the web allows me to experiment and go beyond with its APIs and new features which always allows me to create new and more dynamic applications.

I consider myself very focused and always open to learning and accepting new challenges, today I consider myself to be discovering and exploring new skills like leadership, team development, and large-scale projects, including documentation, performance, and scalability.

## Skills

As a front end here are some technologies, frameworks and languages that I've worked in the last few years:

- JavaScript (NodeJS / TypesScript / CoffeeScript)
- CSS (CSS-in-JS / CSS Pre-processors )
- HTML (HTML 5 / Accessibility / Web Components)
- NodeJS (Native API / Frameworks and Libraries / Creating custom modules)
- Web Apis

Exists a lot of different projects that I've experimented in those years, in a general perspective I think the web base (HTML, CSS and Javascript (and your ecosystem) are whats is more important when we talk about web development.

### Frameworks / Libraries / Misc

- React (Redux / Tests / and stuffs)
- Angular2.x / Angular1.x
- React Native (and stuffs)
- Polymer (Web components)
- Hibrid Mobile Apps (Cordova / Ionic)

I also like to automate or create some personal projects with different languages or frameworks to improve or experiment new technologies.
