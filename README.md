Hi!

I'm Luis Felipe Sousa, Brazilian, 25 years old and over 7 years working in software development especially as a Frontend Developer.

I love technology and everything that can be created with it, I like to explore and always learn something new, and in my free time, I like to read, play chess, or create new features for personal projects.

During my professional career, I have provided services to startups, mid-companies, and large companies like Banco Itaú, Cornershop, and now Uber. On a daily basis, I like to discuss ideas and best practices, and also share knowledge inside and outside the team.

* English / Spanish / Portuguese
